<h1>Hey, I'm Kevin 👋</h1>
<h3>Computer Science Student · Software & Web Developer · Systems Engineer Intern @ Ruckus Networks</h3>

<p>
  I'm a Computer Science student at <b>City University of London</b>, currently interning as a <b>Systems Engineer at Ruckus Networks</b>, where I build internal automation tooling and orchestration platforms used across EMEA.
  <br><br>
  My goal? Keep building cool things, keep learning, and hopefully break as few production systems as possible along the way.

<h3>🚀 What You'll Find Here</h3>

<p>
  A mix of personal projects, experiments, and things I've built along the way — from a <a href="https://webheaven.kevin-caplescu.dev">webhook proxy service</a> for Discord-ROBLOX integration, to an <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-CNC/Enc2024-Cryptography">image-based encryption tool</a> that won <b>Best Cryptography for Society</b> at London Encode 2024. 
  <br><br>
  If you're wondering why my commit count looks modest — I work a lot in private repos and internal systems. The iceberg is real.
